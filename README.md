Call Center Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing call center performance data to evaluate operational efficiency, understand customer behavior, and identify areas for improvement. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, showcasing its capabilities in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to drive actionable insights.

Project Objectives
Analyze Call Volume Trends: Understand call patterns by time, day, and month.
Evaluate Agent Performance: Assess agent productivity and customer resolution rates.
Measure Key Metrics: Track metrics like average call duration, response time, and abandonment rate.
Identify Improvement Areas: Highlight bottlenecks in call handling and suggest process optimizations.
Key Features
Data Cleaning: Ensured data consistency by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Unveiled trends and patterns using Excelâ€™s analytical tools, such as Pivot Tables and charts.
Interactive Dashboards: Created dynamic dashboards to display:
Call volume trends by time, day, and agent.
Agent performance metrics, including average handling time (AHT) and resolution rate.
Customer satisfaction scores (if available).
Insights into abandoned calls and wait times.
Operational Metrics: Evaluated key call center KPIs like Service Level Agreement (SLA) adherence, first-call resolution (FCR), and call abandonment rate.
Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: For data processing, analysis, and dashboard creation.
Excel Features: Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, LOOKUP functions, and Data Validation.
Insights Delivered
Identification of peak call hours and staffing inefficiencies during these periods.
Analysis of agent performance, highlighting top performers and areas for training.
Recommendations to reduce call abandonment by optimizing response times.
Suggestions for improving SLA adherence and enhancing customer satisfaction.
Future Scope
Incorporating customer feedback data to correlate satisfaction with operational metrics.
Extending analysis to include multi-channel support data (e.g., emails, chats).
Utilizing advanced visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau for more comprehensive dashboards.
This project demonstrates how data analysis can empower call centers to improve operations, enhance customer experiences, and achieve better overall efficiency using readily available tools like Excel.
